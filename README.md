Fiction Note Taking Web Application


Fiction building application with multiple tabs to select the category. Within each tab is a form relative to the category were you are able to add an image, specific details and descriptions about your character, item, location, etc. 


Roadmap:

1. Fix image upload not displaying to array.
2. Simplify repeated code for each category upload button. (Rather than having an additional function for every button in each tab, possibly wrap this in a foreach tab--section?).
3. Add a edit text on click to each form data in charsections.
4. Add code for the sorting options button's above charsection's.
5. Add save data to local storage to all form data.
6. Refine the design.
7. Add a display page button where all the form data for each category will be displayed in a new page styled as a blog.
